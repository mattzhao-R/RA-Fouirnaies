# Overview

This repo contains work which I completed as a Research Assistant for Professor Fouirnaies. It contains the inputs, scripts, notebooks, and outputs for two projects I assisted with: [(1) VoteSmart-FollowTheMoney Organization Linktable](###votesmart-followthemoney-linktable) and [(2) Scraping Candidate Biographies](###scraping-candidate-biographies). Both projects heavily involve webscraping and make use of parallelization to improve runtime (both were run on a laptop utilizing 6 out of 8 cores). 

*Note: While the final methods for both projects could be converted to and run as python scripts, I am unable to run scripts myself via terminal despite my best debugging efforts and so I have left them as final notebooks.*


## Workflow

For each project, I began with a working Jupyter Notebook that fully illustrates the work I did to complete each task, including how I created helper functions and my general thought process as I worked on these tasks. The notebooks are by a short-hand version of the name of their respective projects. The methods developed in these notebooks end up in Python scripts and are used by the final notebooks which contain a short chunk of code that, when run, produces the output of each project. 

*Note: For the Linktable project, chromedriver is required and you must [download](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) the version online that matches your current version of Chrome*
