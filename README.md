# Overview

This repo contains work which I completed as a Research Assistant for Professor Fouirnaies. It contains the inputs, scripts, notebooks, and outputs for two projects I assisted with: [(1) VoteSmart-FollowTheMoney Organization Linktable](##votesmart-followthemoney-linktable) and [(2) Scraping Candidate Biographies](##scraping-candidate-biographies). Both projects heavily involve webscraping and make use of parallelization to improve runtime (both were run on a laptop utilizing 6 out of 8 cores). 

*Note: While the final methods for both projects could be converted to and run as python scripts, I am unable to run scripts myself via terminal despite my best debugging efforts and so I have left them as final notebooks.*
